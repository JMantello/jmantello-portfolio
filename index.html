            <p>My experience in software development includes working with C# .NET, ASP.NET, and Kotlin. I have
                experience with Git, Jira, and Bitbucket in a production environment. I have experience with
                MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases. I have experience with Spring Framework and Datadog.</p>
            <p>I've been working as a software developer after having earned an Associate's in Computer Science from
                Renton Technical College in 2022. I love solving problems and creating innovative solutions by
                working through technical challenges and learning key information. I plan to travel around the world
                a little bit at a time starting soon. I have experience in Digital Audio Engineering with another
                Associate's Shoreline Community College.
                I studied music production, recording, signal routing and processing, and I still pursue music
                making on my own and with bands.</p>

                    <p>I worked collaboratively in an Agile setting alongside a team of other interns to design and
                        develop two
                        full-stack
                        financial analysis applications. One was an opportunity cost calculator for paying student loans
                        off
                        quickly versus
                        paying over time and investing the difference. The other was a tool for analyzing costs
                        associated with
                        having
                        dependents with special needs, which will be continued as a new feature of the product.

                        I learned to use Jira and Bitbucket (Git) in a production environment to build C# .NET APIs.
                        Designed
                        and developed APIs
                        with C# .NET and document based databases in MongoDB and PostgreSQL through independent research
                        and
                        discourse with
                        colleagues. Received 1-on-1 mentorship with a dedicated mentor.

                        I also engaged in code reviews with developers. Learned design patterns and code composition,
                        and
                        implemented them into
                        my application's design. Actively asked questions and sought feedback from peers and mentors.I
